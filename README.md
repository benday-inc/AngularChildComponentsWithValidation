# Sample Code: Angular Typed Reactive Form with Child Components & Validations

This repo has the sample code for my [article about Angular child components with validations](https://www.benday.com/2023/05/25/sample-code-angular-typed-reactive-form-with-child-components-validations/).  The gist of that article?  Figuring out how to break up a form in an Angular component into reusable pieces is straightforward enough. But getting that working with Typed Reactive Forms and getting form validations working at the same time proved to be a lot harder.

Well, I figured it out and wanted to share the knowledge with others in the hope that it'll be easier for the next person.

This sample application is running at https://www.benday.com/AngularChildComponentsWithValidation/.
